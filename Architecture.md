## High-Level Architecture

The mini-generative AI website is built using the Django web framework, which follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Models**: Defines the data structure of the application. In this project, models are used to represent user input and generated text.

2. **Views**: Handles the presentation layer logic. Views retrieve data from models and render templates for the user interface.

3. **Templates**: Contains HTML files with embedded Django template language. Templates define the structure and appearance of web pages.

4. **Controller (URL Dispatcher)**: Maps URLs to view functions. It directs incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the URL patterns defined in the `urls.py` file.

## Integration with Gemini AI API

The integration with Gemini AI API is implemented using the `requests` and `google generative-ai`library in Python. When a user submits a text prompt through the website, a POST request is sent to the Gemini AI API endpoint with the prompt text and API key. The API processes the request and returns AI-generated text, which is then displayed to the user on the website.

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables and accessed using the `python dot-env` library to prevent exposure in version control.
- Input validation is performed to prevent malicious input and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Scalability and Deployment

- The application can be easily deployed to various hosting platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- Horizontal scalability can be achieved by deploying multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer.
